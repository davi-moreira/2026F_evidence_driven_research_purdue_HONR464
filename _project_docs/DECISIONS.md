# Course Design Decisions

This document records design decisions made during course development and the reasoning behind them. Decisions here are **load-bearing** — changing them requires deliberate review, not casual edits. New AI assistants and contributors should read this to understand WHY conventions exist before proposing changes.

---

## Decision 1: Flat Notebook Structure

**Decision:** All 21 notebooks live in `/notebooks/` (flat, not nested by week).

**Rationale:**
- Easier to link/reference (simple URLs).
- Clear sequential numbering (`nb00`–`nb20`).
- Students navigate linearly through days.
- GitHub displays flat lists better than nested directories.

---

## Decision 2: 60/20/20 Split for All Examples

**Decision:** Always use 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test.

**Rationale:**
- Consistency across all 21 notebooks.
- Students learn ONE splitting pattern.
- Sufficient validation data for tuning.
- Realistic test set size for course-scale datasets.

---

## Decision 3: `RANDOM_SEED = 474` Everywhere

**Decision:** All random operations use seed 474 (the course number, QM47400).

**Rationale:**
- Complete reproducibility — students get identical outputs.
- Easier to debug — same results every time.
- Course-specific seed (not the generic `42`).
- Memorable for students.

---

## Decision 4: Google Colab + Gemini (Not Local Jupyter)

**Decision:** Primary platform is Google Colab; AI assistance is Google Gemini.

**Rationale:**
- Zero setup for students (no installation issues).
- Consistent environment (same Python/library versions across all students).
- Built-in GPU access (for the deep-learning day).
- Gemini AI assistance integrated natively.
- Accessible from any device.

**Implication for notebook design:** Code must run in a fresh Colab runtime. No hardcoded local paths. Imports must be standard scientific-Python or pip-installable on first cell.

---

## Decision 5: Exclude Admin Materials from Git

**Decision:** `_adm_stuff/` is in `.gitignore`. Instructor notebooks (`*_instructor*.ipynb`) and `video_guides/` are also gitignored.

**Rationale:**
- Student privacy (contact info, accommodations).
- Sensitive data (grades, evaluations).
- Large files (homework solutions, zip archives).
- Public repo — cannot include private materials.
- Instructor solutions must not leak to students browsing the repo.

---

## Decision 6: Micro-Videos (≤12 min each)

**Decision:** All videos capped at 12 minutes maximum.

**Rationale:**
- Attention-span research suggests 10–15 min is optimal for instructional video.
- Mobile-friendly (students can watch on phone).
- Easy to re-watch specific topics.
- Forces concise, focused content.
- ~6 videos per day = ~1 hour total video, leaving time for hands-on notebook work.

---

## Decision 7: "PAUSE-AND-DO" (Not "Exercise" or "Assignment")

**Decision:** Use "PAUSE-AND-DO" terminology for the 10-minute in-notebook practice blocks.

**Rationale:**
- Clear action signal — pause the video, do this now.
- Distinguishes from graded assignments (which are separate).
- Emphasizes active learning over passive reading.
- 10-minute scope — not homework, not a project.
- Builds an engagement habit across all 21 notebooks.

---

## Decision 8: Instructor-First Notebook Editing Workflow

**Decision:** The instructor notebook (`nbNN_*_instructor.ipynb`) is the source of truth. The student notebook (`nbNN_*_student.ipynb`) is generated from it by copy-then-strip-`INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`-cells.

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth — solutions and student version cannot drift.
- Solutions live next to the prompts they answer (easier to maintain).
- Student notebook is generated, never hand-edited; this guarantees the student version is always derivable.
- Allows last-minute solution polish without re-writing the student version separately.

**Implication:** Every cell that should be excluded from the student version MUST contain the literal string `INSTRUCTOR SOLUTION`. The strip script keys on this marker. Unmarked solution cells leak into the student notebook.

---

## Decision 9: CV-First Evaluation, Test-Set Locked Until nb14

**Decision:** From `nb09` onward, all model-performance claims come from cross-validation. The test set (`X_test`, `y_test`) is locked — no model evaluation touches it until `nb14`'s "Opening the Locked Test Set" ceremony.

**Rationale:**
- The test-set-lock ceremony in nb14 is pedagogically central. If the test set is touched 30 times beforehand, the ceremony loses meaning.
- Cross-validation is the professionally honest evaluation method; the course teaches it as the spine.
- Students learn that "I peeked at the test set 30 times before reporting accuracy" is the most common subtle leak in industry.

**Exceptions:**
- `nb14` cell 33 only — the one authorized test-set opening.
- `nb18` Kaggle-submission demo — uses `X_test` to simulate predicting on a held-out CSV (production-pipeline pattern, not model evaluation).

**Implication:** Before every commit in `nb09`–`nb20`, run `scripts/audit_cv_first.py`. The only acceptable hits are the nb14/nb18 exceptions.

---

## Decision 10: Narrative Polish Pattern (nb08 Style)

**Decision:** Every student-notebook markdown cell follows the nb08 narrative style — named business stakeholder in "Why This Matters", flowing prose over bullet lists, inline `"A question that often comes up here"` Q&A blocks, explicit section bridges, warm wrap-ups bridging to the next notebook.

**Rationale:**
- Students read notebooks alone, often late at night. The voice must be encouraging and complete, not skeletal.
- Named stakeholders (HomeValue CFO, MedScreen chief medical officer) make business framing concrete instead of abstract.
- Inline Q&A pre-empts the most common confusions, reducing "I'm stuck and don't know what to ask" moments.
- The `"A question that often comes up here"` phrase is grep-findable for tooling and audits.

**Implication:** New markdown cells longer than ~150 words should be checked against the polish pattern before commit. See `CLAUDE.md` for the polish helper script and the audit checklist.

---

## Decision 11: MC Option-Length Parity in All Assessments

**Decision:** In every multiple-choice question (quizzes, midterm, any future exam), all options must sit in the same length-and-elaboration band: every option ≥ 60% of the question's longest option, and per bank the correct option is strictly longest in ≤ 40% of questions (target ~25%, chance). Distractors carry their own flawed-but-specific rationale at the correct option's elaboration and connector-word density.

**Rationale:**
- In 2026Summer, correct options were authored as full decisions-with-rationale while distractors stayed terse. Two students independently reported (extra-credit program, 2026-06-12) that "always pick the longest option" scored ~100%. Hypothesis tests confirmed it: correct-is-longest in 96% of quiz questions (250 analyzed) and 99.5% of midterm questions (210 analyzed) vs. 25% chance, p < 10⁻¹²³; the midterm's connector-word density showed the same cue.
- Length-balanced, equally-elaborated distractors restore the assessments' validity: the only way to eliminate an option is to recognize the misconception it encodes.

**Exceptions:** none. Numeric/label options satisfy the band by formatting all options in the same shape (e.g., `k = 2` / `k = 100`).

**Implication:** Before importing any quiz/exam CSV to Brightspace, run `python scripts/audit_answer_length.py --file <csv>` — PASS is mandatory. Authoring spec: `scripts/_distractor_rewrite_instructions.md`; per-bank rules embedded in `_quizzes/2026Summer/quiz_generation_plan.md` §4.5 and `_midterm_exam/2026Summer/midterm_generation_plan.md` §5.6. All 48 quiz CSVs and 14 midterm case CSVs were rewritten to this standard on 2026-06-12.

## Decision 12: Adopt the RDSS Taxonomy Outright — the Inquiry Compass (2026-07-19)

**Decision:** Retire the four-approach grid (description / statistical inference /
predictive modeling / causal reasoning) as the course's classification scheme and
adopt the book's own taxonomy: every research question is classified by **kind**
(descriptive vs causal inquiry, RDSS ch. 7) and **reach** (the data at hand / a
population beyond the data / cases not yet seen) — branded in course materials as
the **inquiry compass**. The four deep-dive modules survive as named compass
positions: Description (nb06, descriptive · data at hand), **Generalization**
(nb10, descriptive · population — renames "statistical/observational inference"),
Prediction (nb12, descriptive · unseen cases), Causal reasoning (nb13, causal
kind). MIDA + diagnosis remain the cross-cutting machinery.

**Rationale:**
- The old grid stood *beside* the textbook's taxonomy: students read RDSS ch. 7's
  two-family split while the course taught four families, with no student-facing
  reconciliation. Deriving the positions from kind × reach makes the course and
  its book one system.
- The claim-boundary drills survive stronger: every overclaim is now a **compass
  crossing without its license** — sample→population licensed by a sampling data
  strategy (violation: the silent upgrade), observed→unseen licensed by
  prediction-time honesty + held-out diagnosands (violation: leakage),
  descriptive→causal licensed by assignment/identification (violations:
  after-therefore-because, design mimicry). "You buy kind and reach with your
  data strategy, and you prove the purchase with diagnosis."
- Prediction gets an honest textbook home: nb12 authors the design-library entry
  RDSS stops short of — "Observational: predictive" — in the book's own
  declare-diagnose-redesign format (I = target for unseen units; leakage = a
  data-strategy violation; held-out performance = a diagnosand; baseline
  comparison = redesign).
- EDA is taught as the **explore → declare → confirm loop**, not a topic:
  upstream M-calibration (nb04), the named anchor (nb06), the §9.1.3
  whole-procedure rule (nb09), and ch. 22 pivoting/reconciliation (nb17).

**Implication:** `course_config.yaml` now carries `inquiry_framework:` (replacing
`approaches:`); `planning/INQUIRY_MAP.md` (renamed from QUANTITATIVE_APPROACH_MAP)
is canonical; the notebook template block is `## 🧭 Inquiry & Claim Boundary` with
`**Inquiry emphasis:**` (validator updated); the schedule column is `inquiry`
(renamed from `approach`); the student template is
`project/templates/INQUIRY_DECLARATION.md` with kind/reach checkboxes and a
crossing-licenses table; the CLAUDE.md critical rule is "Inquiry-Declaration
Justification". Notebook filenames (e.g., `nb02_four_approaches*`) were kept for
link stability — display titles changed everywhere.

---

## Decision 13: Friday Studios + Phase 1–2 Compression (2026-07-20)

**Decision:** Every Friday is a **studio**: ≈10 min topic recap + ≈10 min
instructor presentation of the next project milestone (from its Brightspace
brief) + ≈30 min supervised milestone/project work with rotating consults. No
new topic content on Fridays. Simultaneously, Phases 1–2 compress from 14
meetings to ~10: P1 = M1–M4 (nb00=1, nb01=2 lectures), P2 = M5–M11 (nb02–nb05
one lecture each), with Phase 2 content ending Wed Sep 16 (week 4). Freed slots
flow to Phase 3 (now M12–M22: nb06=1, nb07/nb09/nb10 two lectures each). nb08
becomes the async Friday-studio module (Oct 2, M05 work day). Every milestone is
kicked off on a Friday; three due dates moved (M00 Aug 26→Aug 28, M03 Sep
16→Sep 18, M05 Oct 7→Oct 2); hard anchors (M07 Oct 9/16, M12 Nov 6, M16 Nov 17,
M22 Dec 7/9, M23 Dec 11) unchanged.

**Rationale:** The prior calendar front-loaded question-formulation and
literature/measurement (32% of the semester) while layering milestone
presentations on top of new Friday content. A fixed weekly rhythm — learn
Mon/Wed, consolidate and build the project Fri — protects project time,
makes milestone expectations explicit, and moves students into the technical
phases (data, answer strategies, diagnosis) a week earlier.

**Implication:** `scripts/schedule_data/part1–4.py` rewritten; lecture labels
derived via `lecture_labels()` in `scripts/notebooks_map.py`; session guides and
notebooks reference lectures (never meetings or dates).

---

## Decision 14: Undergraduate-Friendly Voice (2026-07-20 — supersedes D10's punctuation habits)

**Decision:** Keep D10's narrative machinery (named-stakeholder "Why This
Matters" openers, "A question that often comes up here" Q&A blocks, prose over
bullets, bridges, warm wrap-ups) but enforce an undergraduate-friendly voice:
em-dashes ≤ 20 per notebook and ≤ 1 per markdown cell; every technical term
introduced as bold term → one-sentence plain definition → concrete example;
sentences ~12–25 words; second person throughout; no fourth-wall meta-references
about how the material was constructed.

**Rationale:** The built notebooks averaged ~2 em-dashes per markdown cell and
introduced compass/RDSS jargon without plain-language onboarding — reading as
AI-generated and taxing for honors students with no quantitative background.
MGMT474's student notebooks (the course's infra ancestor) demonstrate the
target: same pedagogy, restrained punctuation, term-definition-example rhythm.

**Implication:** `scripts/voice_lint_notebooks.py` gains an em-dash budget,
banned meta-phrases, and date-pattern checks; `_project_docs/ACTIVITY_TEMPLATE.md`
§5 rewritten; all 20 notebook sources rewritten and rebuilt.

---

## Decision 15: Material/Schedule Split, Dataset Zip, Password-Gated Instructor Tab (2026-07-20)

**Decision:** The site splits into **Material** (topic-indexed: notebook Colab
badge, dataset zip, readings — generated by `scripts/build_material_page.py`)
and **Schedule** (date-indexed calendar) tabs, QM670-style. All datasets live in
`notebooks/data/` and ship as one bundle `notebooks/data/honr46400_datasets.zip`
(regenerated by `scripts/make_dataset_zip.py`), linked from both pages. A new
**Instructor** tab is client-side encrypted (password `eureka`,
`scripts/protect_instructor_page.py`, wired post-render) and lists Colab badges
pointing at the private repo
`davi-moreira/2026F_evidence_driven_research_purdue_HONR464_instructor`, synced
by `scripts/sync_instructor_repo.sh` from gitignored local material.

**Rationale:** Students need a stable topic-indexed resource catalog separate
from the calendar; a single zip is the offline data path; the instructor needs
the same one-click Colab access to solution notebooks without ever committing
them to the public repo. The page password is a courtesy lock — the private repo
plus GitHub auth is the real protection.

---

## Decision 16: Fabricated Citations Removed Course-Wide (2026-07-20)

**Decision:** The planted-fake-citation teaching device (previously nb00, nb03,
nb08, nb15) is removed entirely. Citation-verification skills are taught with
real, retrievable sources that students locate and confirm. `scripts/audit_sources.py`
now treats the former planted-fake names as a hard blocklist with no disclosure
exemption.

**Rationale:** The device required fourth-wall meta-asides ("fabricated for the
verification exercise") that undercut the course's own evidence-integrity spine
and read as AI-generated filler. Verifying real sources exercises the same
skill without shipping fakes in student material.
